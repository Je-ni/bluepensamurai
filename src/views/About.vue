    <p>
      i am a warrior that wanders the land and encounters moments. every moment
      has lines and feelings in them which i have to illustrate. these are
      battles; some are strong, some are weak, some are kind, some are dirty,
      some are elusive, and some dance. but i have to defeat them so they can be
      my friends. all those lines that bend a lot, all those impulses,
      expressions, urges, conversations, flashes that go away when you blink,
      all those incomplete pictures that come together to make one story, that’s
      me, that’s my work, and these are my people.
